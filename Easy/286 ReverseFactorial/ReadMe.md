I'll be honest - I started with a for loop rather than a while loop and it was a mistake to do so. 
It didn't matter a whole lot but I ended up confusing myself. I also started by using divisibleInput > 1 as a condition. That was also a mistake and I realized it would be easier to just track that it's always divisible.
