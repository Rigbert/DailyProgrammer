UUEncoder: Works in cout in first commit because I couldn't be bothered to implement file handling right off the bat. There is a commented out section involving that.

This was one of the first projects and I didn't realize I wanted to put it in public so forgive me for the lack there of comments

This was also my first experience with encoding so everything isn't perfectly prisitine. I'm also writing this my freshman year of college.
