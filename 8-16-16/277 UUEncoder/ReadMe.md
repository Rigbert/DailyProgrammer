#UUEncoder: 
Just a simple UUEncoding project. Turns text you put into the standard input and returns that text but encoded.
Doesn't work with files yet because I haven't gotten around to bothering with file names. Will probably come back by the end of the week- written on 10/5/16

This was one of the first projects and I didn't realize I wanted to put it in public so forgive me for the lack of comments to explain the variables. And the variable names aren't the greatest either because of that.

This was also my first experience with encoding so everything isn't perfectly prisitine. I'm also writing this my freshman year of college.
